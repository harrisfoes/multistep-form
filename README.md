## Overview

A multi-step form project in React and TailwindCSS

I took on this project in order to learn how validation works in React and see how well it manages multiple states especially if we have forms with different requirements.

This project looks simple at first glance but there's a lot in this that earns it its "ADVANCED" difficulty rating in Frontendmentor.

Some of these include:

- the many moving parts in header / step indicators
- the strictness of handling multiple forms
- each new page takes logic from the previous page
- lots of state pieces to manage

Overall I enjoyed this challenge and would recommend it to other learners.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

I implemented this project in steps using mobile-first design.

- Start with the markup then find ways to separate the items into components.
- After finishing the UI, look into the logic and implement the necessary hooks
- Worked on Tablet and Desktop last

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Form validation in React
- Managing state for dynamic CSS styles
- Most prop drilling I've ever done (scope of project does not merit using context)

### Continued development

Project is considered finished

### Useful resources

Google, ChatGPT, Mozilla documentation, Youtube
